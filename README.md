## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

Motivation - This is my first piece of work hosted on Github.I would say that, this is the starting point of my learning Github and Web Development using Python, Hoping to build some more complex Web apps using python.

Project Description - This is very simple to do app which is giving four options :-
(add - (adding new to do item), show - (showing the list of to-do items), delete - (deleting an item from to-do) and exit)

Learnings - By building this very basic app, I gained hands on expirence on working with text files by adding and deleteing the to-do items as instructed by user.
