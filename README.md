# Todo-app


## Motivation
This is my first project on GitHub. It's my starting point for learning how to use GitHub and build websites with Python. I hope to make more complex web apps with Python in the future.

## Project Description
This is a simple to-do list app with two main features:

Clicking on a checkbox deletes a to-do item.
You can add new to-do items to the list.

## Learnings
By making this basic app, I learned how to work with text files. I could add and delete to-do items as the user wanted.
